# Human-Activity-Recognition
The exploration of human activity recognition utilizing smartphone data involves leveraging machine learning methodologies to discern various physical activities based on information gathered from the sensors embedded within a smartphone. These experiments were conducted with a cohort of 30 participants ranging in age from 19 to 48 years old. Each individual engaged in six distinct activities (WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) while wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) positioned at the waist. Through the utilization of its built-in accelerometer and gyroscope, data capturing encompassed 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a consistent rate of 50Hz. 

The dataset acquired from these endeavors underwent a meticulous process of manual labeling through video recordings. This dataset was then randomly divided into two sets, with 70% of the volunteers contributing to the training data and the remaining 30% allocated for the test data.

Pre-processing of the sensor signals, which encompassed accelerometer and gyroscope data, involved applying noise filters and subsequently sampling them into fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 seconds with a 50% overlap (128 readings per window). Further refinement involved segregating the sensor acceleration signal into its constituent gravitational and body motion components using a Butterworth low-pass filter. This separation was critical as it allowed for distinct treatment of the gravitational force, presumed to possess solely low-frequency components, thus employing a filter with a 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency.

From each window, a feature vector was derived by computing variables from both the time and frequency domains. These features were carefully selected to encapsulate relevant information for discerning between the various activities performed by the study participants.

The overarching objective of this project is to harness this pre-processed data to train a machine learning model proficient in accurately classifying the activities undertaken by the participants. This entails extracting pertinent features, training the model utilizing techniques such as decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, or neural networks, and subsequently evaluating its performance on an independent test dataset to gauge its generalization capabilities to new instances of activities.
